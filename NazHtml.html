      <h3>Bengal Tiger</h3>
      <p>Today, due to habitat loss caused by deforestation, and hunting by human poachers, the Bengal tiger is considered to be an endangered species.</p>

      <h3>Giant Panda</h3>
      <p>Giant pandas first became endangered in 1990 due to excessive poaching in the 80s and deforestation, depleting their bamboo food source.</p>

      <h3>Snow Leopard</h3>
      <p>Humans are a second reason that snow leopards are endangered. Humans have pushed ever further with their livestock into the snow leopard's habitat.</p>

      <h3>Rhino</h3>
      <p>This situation has exacerbated threats such as trade in rhino horn and increased poaching due to poverty. Today, black rhinos remain critically endangered because of rising demand for rhino horn, from some Asian consumers, particularly in Vietnam and China, who use them in folk remedies.</p>

  <h3>Polar Bear</h3>
  <p>Because of ongoing and potential loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate change, polar bears were listed as a threatened species in the US under the Endangered Species Act in May 2008.</p>
  <p>We can all contribute to reducing climate change, and therefore help polar bears and other endangered species. A significant cause of climate change is the emission of polluting gases from burning fossil fuels, such as coal and oil. Fossil fuels are burned when we use electricity or drive our cars, among other things.</p>
